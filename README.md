This s a basic Project where ARCore is used for surface mapping and then putting objects onto that surface. 


To get a foundational understanding and overview of the AR trends and technology, I completed a course on Coursera named:
Introduction to Augmented Reality and ARCore

(I completed this course without Certification)
